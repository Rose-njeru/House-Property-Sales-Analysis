# House-Property-Sales-Analysis
The retail industry now heavily relies on data analytics tools to better estimate the prices of different properties. This case study analyses the sales of house properties in a city in Australia.

## Problem Statement

This data analytics project aims to analyze and derive insights from the property sales dataset  to  understand the factors influencing property prices and explore trends in the real estate market.

## Objectives
 **Price Determinants**
 
 Identify  factors influencing property prices, such as location, property type, and the number of bedrooms.

**Market Trends**

Analyze trends in property sales over time to understand how the market has evolved.

**Geographic Variation**

Explore geographic variation in property prices by analyzing data across different postcodes.

 **Bedroom Analysis**

 Investigate how the number of bedrooms affects property prices and demand.

 **Market Performance**
 
 Evaluate the overall performance of the real estate market based on property sales data.
